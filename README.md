# SpaceNotifications
A notification server for CLI based operating systems.

### How to compile?
To compile SpaceNotifications, you have to have Boost library installed.

Once you've installed the Boost library, you can compile SpaceNotifications by Makefile with using following command:

```
make all
```

To compile server only, type the following to your terminal:

```
make server

```
And, if you want to compile the example only, you can use this command:

```
make example

```

### Compilation on Windows
It is also pretty easy to compile SpaceNotifications on Windows, just open your favourite IDE and compile, or install MinGW and run the Makefile with "make.exe" that came along with MinGW.
